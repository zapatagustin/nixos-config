## Executor Override

If you ARE the sub-agent (NOT the orchestrator), the gate below does NOT apply to you. Continue with the phase work below. Do NOT delegate. Do NOT call the Skill tool. You are the executor — execute.

> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are
> the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Do NOT execute these instructions inline. Delegate to
> the dedicated `sdd-init` sub-agent using your platform's delegation primitive
> (e.g., `task(...)`, sub-agent invocation, etc.). This skill is for EXECUTORS
> only.



## Language Domain Contract

Generated technical artifacts default to English. Do not inherit the user's conversational language or the active persona's regional voice for SDD artifacts unless the user explicitly requests that artifact language or the project convention requires it.

If Spanish technical artifacts are explicitly requested, use neutral/professional Spanish unless the user explicitly asks for a regional variant.

Public/contextual comments follow the target context language by default. Explicit user language or tone overrides win; Spanish comments default to neutral/professional Spanish unless the user or target context clearly calls for regional tone.

## Activation Contract

Run this phase when the orchestrator/user asks to initialize SDD in a project. You are the phase executor: do the work yourself, do not delegate, and do not behave like the orchestrator.

## Hard Rules

- Detect the real stack, conventions, architecture, testing tools, and persistence mode; never guess.
- In `ecomono-memory` mode, do **not** create `openspec/`.
- In `openspec` mode, follow `../_shared/openspec-convention.md` and write file artifacts.
- In `hybrid` mode, write both openspec files and ecomono-memory observations.
- Always persist testing capabilities separately as `sdd/{project}/testing-capabilities` or `openspec/config.yaml` `testing:`.
- Always build `.atl/skill-registry.md`; also save `skill-registry` to ecomono-memory when available.
- If `openspec/` already exists, report what exists and ask before updating it.

## Decision Gates

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| `mode=ecomono-memory` | Save context and capabilities to ecomono-memory only. |
| `mode=openspec` | Create/update openspec bootstrap files only. |
| `mode=hybrid` | Do both ecomono-memory and openspec persistence. |
| `mode=none` | Return detected context only; write no SDD artifacts except registry if required. |
| strict TDD marker/config found | Use that value. |
| no marker/config but test runner exists | Default `strict_tdd: true`. |
| no test runner | Set `strict_tdd: false` and explain unavailable. |

## Execution Steps

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, CI, lint/test config) and summarize stack/conventions.
2. Detect test runner, test layers, coverage, linter, type checker, and formatter.
3. Resolve Strict TDD from agent marker, `openspec/config.yaml`, detected runner fallback, or no-runner fallback.
4. Initialize persistence for the resolved mode.
5. Build `.atl/skill-registry.md` using the skill-registry scan rules.
6. Persist testing capabilities and project context.
7. Return the structured initialization envelope.

## Output Contract

Return `status`, `executive_summary`, `artifacts`, `next_recommended`, and `risks`. Include project, stack, persistence mode, Strict TDD status, testing capability table, saved observation IDs/paths, registry path, and next `/sdd-explore` or `/sdd-new` step.
