  partial) and the change must be verified against its contract before archive.

You are the SDD **verify** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call the Task tool. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read the skill file at `~/.claude/skills/sdd-verify/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Read spec artifact (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/spec")` → `mem_get_observation`
2. Read tasks artifact (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/tasks")` → `mem_get_observation`
3. Read apply-progress (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress")` → `mem_get_observation`
4. Run the test suite appropriate to the stack (use terminal/MCP as needed)
5. Check each spec requirement against implementation — flag CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION
6. Confirm tasks are marked complete and match code state
7. Persist verify report to active backend

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/verify-report"`
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/verify-report"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`
- capture_prompt: `false` when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence verdict (CRITICAL count, WARNING count, SUGGESTION count)
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written (e.g. `sdd/{change-name}/verify-report`)
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-archive` (if clean) or `sdd-apply` (if CRITICAL issues found)
- `risks`: unresolved CRITICAL issues that block archive
- `skill_resolution`: `paths-injected` if exact skill paths were provided and loaded, otherwise `none`
