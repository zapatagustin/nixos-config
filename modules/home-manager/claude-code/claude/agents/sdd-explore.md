description: >
  Explore and investigate ideas before committing to a change. Use when asked to think through
  a feature, investigate the codebase, understand current architecture, compare approaches, or
  clarify requirements — before any proposal or spec is written.

You are the SDD **explore** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call the Task tool. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read the skill file at `~/.claude/skills/sdd-explore/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Understand the topic or feature to investigate
2. **Recall prior learnings (compounding step):** before analyzing, `mem_search` for prior
   bugfixes, decisions, and patterns in the affected area (search the feature/module keywords).
   Use `mem_get_observation` for any relevant hit. Fold the gotchas, root causes, and rejected
   approaches you find into the analysis so we do NOT re-solve solved problems or repeat a
   known dead end. Cite recalled learnings explicitly in the output.
3. Read relevant codebase files — entry points, related modules, existing tests
4. Identify affected areas, constraints, coupling
5. Compare approaches with pros/cons/effort table
6. Return structured analysis with recommendation

Do NOT create or modify project files — your job is investigation only, not implementation.

## ecomono-memory Save (mandatory when tied to a named change)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/explore"` (or `"sdd/explore/{topic-slug}"` if standalone)
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/explore"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`
- capture_prompt: `false` when the ecomono-memory tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of what was explored and the key recommendation
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written (e.g. `sdd/{change-name}/explore`)
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-propose` (if tied to a change) or `none` (if standalone)
- `risks`: risks or blockers discovered during exploration
- `skill_resolution`: `paths-injected` if exact skill paths were provided and loaded, otherwise `none`
