description: Continue the next SDD phase in the dependency chain
---

Follow the SDD orchestrator workflow inline using the instructions already installed in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
The Claude Code session model is controlled by Claude Code; Gentle AI only configures models for Agent tool calls to phase sub-agents.

WORKFLOW:

1. If the `gentle-ai` binary is available, run `gentle-ai sdd-continue [change] --cwd <repo>` and treat its dispatcher/status output as authoritative — but only when the session artifact store is `openspec` or `hybrid`. When the session artifact store is `engram`, do NOT invoke the native dispatcher at all — it cannot see the change (it reads only `openspec/changes/`); resolve status entirely from Engram (`mem_search` + `mem_get_observation` on the change's topic keys) using the manual status schema in `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-status-contract.md` (the same schema used when the binary is unavailable). The dispatcher is authoritative only for `openspec`/`hybrid`. If unavailable, read `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-status-contract.md` and produce structured status before acting.
2. Resolve the active change. If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing and more than one active change exists, ask the user to choose and STOP. Do not guess.
3. Check which artifacts already exist for the active change (proposal, specs, design, tasks)
4. Determine the next phase needed based on the dependency graph:
   proposal → [specs ∥ design] → tasks → apply → verify → archive
5. Launch the appropriate sub-agent(s) for the next phase only if authoritative status says the dependency is ready. Route only by `nextRecommended` and dependency states; never infer from free text. If `blockedReasons` is non-empty, do not proceed to apply, archive, or terminal work. If `nextRecommended` is `verify`, verification/remediation may run only to refresh evidence; if `nextRecommended` is `resolve-blockers`, report `blockedReasons` and stop; if `nextRecommended` is a planning token (`propose`, `spec`, `design`, or `tasks`), launch the corresponding planning phase. Carry `actionContext` and allowed edit roots into any sub-agent launch.
6. Present the result and ask the user to proceed

CONTEXT:

- Working directory: Detect agent-side before proceeding by running `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` with the Bash tool; if that fails, run `pwd` with the Bash tool.
- Current project: Derive agent-side from the detected working directory basename. Do not use slash-command shell interpolation for this value.
- Change name: $ARGUMENTS
- Execution mode: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Artifact store mode: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Delivery strategy: ask/cache per orchestrator

ENGRAM NOTE:
To check which artifacts exist, search: mem_search(query: "sdd/$ARGUMENTS/", project: "{project}") to list all artifacts for this change.
Sub-agents handle persistence automatically with topic_key "sdd/$ARGUMENTS/{type}".

Read the orchestrator instructions to coordinate this workflow. Do NOT execute phase work inline when a native sub-agent is available.

STATUS CONTRACT:

Prefer `gentle-ai sdd-continue [change] --cwd <repo>` when available — but only when the session artifact store is `openspec` or `hybrid`; when the store is `engram`, do NOT invoke the binary and resolve status from Engram using the manual status schema. Otherwise read `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-status-contract.md` and follow it. If status reports `workspace-planning` with no allowed edit roots, do not launch apply/verify/archive work that would infer repo-local ownership.
