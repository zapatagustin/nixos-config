description: Validate implementation matches specs, design, and tasks
---

If the native `sdd-verify` sub-agent is available, delegate this command to it.
Otherwise, read the skill file at `~/.claude/skills/sdd-verify/SKILL.md` FIRST, then follow its instructions exactly inline.

CONTEXT:
- Working directory: Detect agent-side before proceeding by running `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` with the Bash tool; if that fails, run `pwd` with the Bash tool.
- Current project: Derive agent-side from the detected working directory basename. Do not use slash-command shell interpolation for this value.
- Artifact store mode: engram

TASK:
Verify the active SDD change. Read the proposal, specs, design, and tasks artifacts. Then:

STATUS GATE:
Read `~/.claude/skills/_shared/sdd-status-contract.md` and produce structured status before acting. If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing or ambiguous, ask the user to choose and STOP. Do not guess. Continue only when tasks and implementation evidence exist. If status reports `workspace-planning`, STOP and explain that full workspace implementation verification is not supported in this slice. Carry `contextFiles`, task progress, dependency states, and `actionContext` into the native sub-agent prompt when delegating.

ENGRAM PERSISTENCE (artifact store mode: engram):
CRITICAL: mem_search returns 300-char PREVIEWS, not full content. You MUST call mem_get_observation(id) for EVERY artifact.
STEP A — SEARCH (get IDs only):
  mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/spec", project: "{project}") → save spec_id
  mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/design", project: "{project}") → save design_id
  mem_search(query: "sdd/{change-name}/tasks", project: "{project}") → save tasks_id
STEP B — RETRIEVE FULL CONTENT (mandatory):
  mem_get_observation(id: spec_id) → full spec
  mem_get_observation(id: design_id) → full design
  mem_get_observation(id: tasks_id) → full tasks
Save report:
  mem_save(title: "sdd/{change-name}/verify-report", topic_key: "sdd/{change-name}/verify-report", type: "architecture", project: "{project}", capture_prompt: false, content: "{verification report}")
  Set capture_prompt: false when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

Then:
1. Check completeness — are all tasks done?
2. Check correctness — does code match specs?
3. Check coherence — were design decisions followed?
4. Run tests and build (real execution)
5. Build the spec compliance matrix

Return a structured verification report with: status, executive_summary, detailed_report, artifacts, and next_recommended.
