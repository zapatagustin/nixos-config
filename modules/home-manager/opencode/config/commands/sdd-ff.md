description: Fast-forward all SDD planning phases — proposal through tasks
agent: gentle-orchestrator
---

Follow the SDD orchestrator workflow to fast-forward all planning phases for change "$ARGUMENTS".

HARD GATE:
SDD Session Preflight must already be complete for this session. It must include execution mode, artifact store, chained PR strategy, and review budget. If missing, ask the exact orchestrator preflight prompt and STOP. Do not launch planning sub-agents in the same turn.

WORKFLOW:
Honor the cached execution mode from SDD Session Preflight.

Planning phases:

1. sdd-propose — create the proposal
2. sdd-spec — write specifications
3. sdd-design — create technical design
4. sdd-tasks — break down into implementation tasks

- In `interactive` mode: run only the next planning phase, present its summary and artifact path(s), ask whether to adjust or continue, then STOP. Do not launch the following phase until the user confirms.
- In `auto` mode: run all planning phases back-to-back and present a combined summary after all phases complete.

CONTEXT:

- Working directory: before doing anything else, run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd` with your bash tool and use the returned path as the authoritative workspace. In OpenCode Desktop (Electron) the parse-time interpolation resolves to the app data directory, not the project.
- Current project: the `basename` of the detected workspace above.
- Change name: $ARGUMENTS
- Execution mode: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Artifact store mode: ask/cache per orchestrator; do not hardcode Engram
- Delivery strategy: ask/cache per orchestrator
- Review budget: ask/cache per orchestrator

ENGRAM NOTE:
Sub-agents handle persistence automatically using the selected artifact store. In engram/hybrid, each phase saves with topic_key "sdd/$ARGUMENTS/{type}" where type is: proposal, spec, design, tasks.

Read the orchestrator instructions to coordinate this workflow. Do NOT execute phase work inline — delegate to sub-agents.
